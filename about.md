Colorado Community Radio Network is a group of independent, volunteer run, commercial free radio stations, that focus on providing their audience with coverage, that is relevant to local communities. We formed in the spring of 2013, united by our battle against the corporate domination of the air waves. At our first meeting, at the Very Nice Brewing Company in Nederland, we brainstormed how our stations could effectively work together, while remaining independent. Since then we have been sharing content and equipment, sponsoring and live broadcasting local events, covering music festivals, promoting the the network and helping each other stay on air.

In spring of 2015 we sponsored our first event, Frozen Dead Guy Days. We setup a popup station on 93.1 FM, in a tuff shed at the heart of the event. We interviewed bands playing the festival, DJs ran some frozen contests and we even had local artists Banshee Tree play live on air. In may DJ SkyFly and Pharlo went to Campout for the Cause to get interviews with artists and festival attendees. At the end of August, CCRN sponsored the Hill Block Party, interviewed local artists and broadcast the entire event and after party over the network. In September we promoted Telluride Blues and Brews, where DJ SkyFly and Pharlo went to interview bands. We are constantly finding new events to cover and want to expand our local content as much as possible.

One major goal of CCRN, is to spread micro independent radio, throughout the state and beyond. Part of that goal is to consolidate information for those interested in starting new stations, and helping new stations get on air by providing equipment, training and technical support. This site serves as the platform to provide those resources and we hope to eventually have an all encompassing guide to creating and running a station and how to share content over our network.

We have many more projects in the works, so stay tuned to your local member station or listen to one online, to stay up to date with CCRN.
